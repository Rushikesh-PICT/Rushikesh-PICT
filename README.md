👋 Hi, I’m Rushikesh Sarode

👀 I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in building end-to-end web applications. I love tackling complex problems, from designing scalable Java/Spring Boot microservices on the backend to building responsive, user-friendly UIs with React on the frontend.

🌱 I'm currently deepening my expertise in cloud-native architectures, focusing on Kubernetes (K8s) and advanced microservice patterns like event-driven design with Kafka.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging full-stack projects, especially those involving Java microservices and React. I'm also open to contributing to open-source tools in the Java/DevOps ecosystem.

🚀 I am actively seeking new opportunities for a Full-Stack Engineer role.

⚡ Fun Fact: My engineering brain doesn't shut off! My background isn't just in software—I started my career by integrating the hardware (VCUs, MCUs) that runs the software in electric vehicles.
